## Project Overview

This project involves designing and implementing a relational database system for managing bookstore data. The goal is to create a stable and efficient schema that supports various operations for data storage, access control, and analysis.

## Objectives

- Create a new database to store bookstore-related data.
- Determine a stable schema and choose appropriate data types.
- Write SQL commands to create tables based on the defined schema.
- Set up user roles and privileges to manage database access.
- Test the database using a set of queries to retrieve and analyze data.

## Key Features

- **Normalized Schema**: Designed to avoid data redundancy and ensure data integrity.
- **Secure Access Control**: Role-based access implemented for different user levels (e.g., admin, staff).
- **Efficient Queries**: Tested using SQL queries to validate the structure and retrieve meaningful insights.

## Database Structure

- Tables include: `Books`, `Authors`, `Categories`, `Customers`, `Orders`, `OrderItems`, `Users` 
- Relationships between tables are established using primary and foreign keys.
